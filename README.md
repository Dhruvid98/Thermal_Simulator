# AI Thermal Throttling Simulator
## Overview
The AI Thermal Throttling Simulator models how data center racks perform under varying TDP loads, ambient temperatures, and cooling strategies. It’s designed to help data center architects, AI infrastructure planners, and HPC engineers anticipate performance loss due to thermal constraints.

## Key Features
* Simulates rack-level thermal throttling effects for GPUs, CPUs, TPUs, and custom accelerators.
* Models real-world factors: ambient temperature, airflow, liquid cooling, and TDP.
* Provides quick “what-if” analysis for cooling-performance trade-offs.
* Supports planning for high-density AI/HPC deployments.

## Why It Matters
Thermal throttling can lead to significant performance degradation, unplanned downtime, and higher operational costs. This tool helps identify and mitigate risks before hardware deployment.
